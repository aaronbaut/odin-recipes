        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I bet you if you had this <strong>pan-fried sesame garlic tofu</strong>, you would change your tune on tofu! I have been loving tofu in my dishes lately. It's a great source of <strong>protein</strong> and <strong>low in fat</strong>. It's so tender too and it soaks up all the flavor of the dish.It's a great blank slate and super versatile.Think of it like the <em>vegetarian's chicken</em>, haha I mean, kind of is. We add chicken to our dishes to flavor it up and have it soak up the flavors of the dish. Tofu is basically doing the same.</p>
             
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Tofu</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>Sambal oelek</li>
                <li>Rice Vinegear</li>
                <li>Honey</li>
                <li>Sesame Oil</li>
              </ul>
              
            <h3>Steps</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Place two paper towels on a plate then place the entire block of tofu (drained from its packaging liquid) onto the plate. Place two more paper towels on top of the tofu then put a heavy item on top. Not TOO heavy that it would completely crush the tofu but heavy enough that it can squeeze out liquid.
                  I like using a cast iron skillet.
                  Leave for 30 minutes and halfway through, change out the paper towels.
                  ALTERNATIVELY and more eco-friendly: place a wire baking rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet. Place tofu on top and then put a heavy object on top and let drain for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the tofu has drained, slice in half then into cubes and place into a large bowl. Sprinkle cornstarch on top and gently toss with your hands to ensure all tofu pieces are covered.</li>  
                <li>In a large skillet, add sesame oil and vegetable oil then bring up to medium-high heat.</li>  
                <li>Once oil is heated up, add the tofu to the skillet and let brown on all sides.</li>  
                <li>In the meantime, whisk together the ingredients for the sauce.</li>  
                <li>Once the tofu has browned and crisped up on all sides, add the sauce to the skillet and it should start to thicken immediately. Toss the tofu around to coat then remove from heat.</li>  
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>  

              </ol>
