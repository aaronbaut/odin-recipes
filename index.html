        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I bet you if you had this <strong>pan-fried sesame garlic tofu</strong>, you would change your tune on tofu! I have been loving tofu in my dishes lately. It's a great source of <strong>protein</strong> and <strong>low in fat</strong>. It's so tender too and it soaks up all the flavor of the dish.It's a great blank slate and super versatile.Think of it like the <em>vegetarian's chicken</em>, haha I mean, kind of is. We add chicken to our dishes to flavor it up and have it soak up the flavors of the dish. Tofu is basically doing the same.</p>
