        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I bet you if you had this pan-fried sesame garlic tofu, you would change your tune on tofu! I have been loving tofu in my dishes lately. It’s a great source of protein and low in fat. It’s so tender too and it soaks up all the flavor of the dish.It’s a great blank slate and super versatile.Think of it like the vegetarian’s chicken, hahaI mean, kind of is. We add chicken to our dishes to flavor it up and have it soak up the flavors of the dish. Tofu is basically doing the same.</p>
